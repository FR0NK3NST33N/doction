# Doction


### WIP

This is a wip idea for a nodejs package that could eventually function similarly to a JSDoc. Instead of building a static site for docs, the idea would be to hook into Notion's API for generating hosted pages. 

### Goal 1

Generate docs for a prisma schema 


#### Running Locally 

`cargo run --bin prisma_example`
`cargo run --bin notion_example`
